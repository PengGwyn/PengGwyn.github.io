                <p class="about">
                    Hello, I'm Gwynard Andaya a student that
                    study school subjects and also programming.
                    I'm a game programmer since 2019 and in the year 2020
                    I improved my coding skills and published my 1st
                    flappy game on my itch.io website. <br> <br>
                    Before I started my journey as a game developer, I'm
                    just a little boy that play a game every day and I realized
                    that I'm addicted to it. Until one day, I think about my future
                    on what I want to be. That time I'm thinking that I wanna be
                    an architect, inventor, artist so I try it. But I realized my drawings are 
                    crazy and then I became lazy doing it. So I think this isn't for me.
                    So I talk to my Kuya or my church mate then ask him "what is a good job
                    for me for the future? I want to make and feel cool and I like making
                    things that make me happy, fun, and usable. So he replied that I should be an 
                    Inventor. But it cost a lot and needs a lot of money so I just say "It's too expensive
                    for me. I guess hehe" then I know that my Kuya is a programmer so I ask him "what do programmers do?"
                    and to make the story short he explains it to me and I feel like "Oh wow cool. It's like magic"
                    so I become interested in programming I also ask him what programming language should I use.?
                    and after that, it ended up using c# as my 1st programming language. Then my journey begins.
